# The Telemetrix Project

Telemetry is the collection of measurements or other data at remote points and their 
automatic transmission to receiving equipment (telecommunication) for monitoring.

The Telemetrix-AIO Project is a telemetry package for Arduino core devices using a serial interface.
This is the asyncio version of the telemetrix Python client.


It is early stages of this project, so there are may be some bugs lurking.
A word about the current directory structure. 

Arduino-telemetrix is the Arduino server sketch, and telemetrix-aio is the python client.

The API may be found [here.](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/telemetrix-aio/blob/master/html/index.html)
